## Assignment:
The goal of this assignment is to develop a simple service that interacts with the Mastodon API to programmatically create, retrieve, and delete posts. You will also build a basic web UI to demonstrate these functionalities and include appropriate unit tests.
## Solution:
### What is Mastodon?
Mastodon is a free, open-source social media platform developed by a non-profit organization and is similar to Twitter. Mastodon is not a single website; to use it we need to make an account with provider called Servers, that lets us connect to other people across Mastodon.
